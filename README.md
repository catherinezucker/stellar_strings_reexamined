# Disconnecting the Dots: Re-examining the Nature of Stellar "Strings" in the Milky Way

This repository reproduces Table 1 and the data behind the figures for Figure 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Zucker, Peek & Loebman 2022, showing that the stellar strings from [Kounkel & Covey 2019](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab339a) are largely inconsistent with being physical objects whose members share a common origin. 

Required dependencies to run the Jupyter Notebook include both [astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html) and [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation). 

Most of the data are downloaded directly from Vizier via the astroquery package, with the exception of the data from [Manea, Hawkins, & Mass 2022]( https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac236) (Manea2022_Supplementary_Table.fits and Manea2022_M67_dispersion.fits) which contains the intrinsic abundance information for a sample of strings and the M67 cluster, respectively. We derive these tables from the Supplementary Data file provided in [Manea, Hawkins, & Maas 2022]( https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac236) which is availale for download in the online version of their published articled.
